	abstract = {Interactions between bacteria and the viruses that infect them (i.e., phages) have profound effects on biological processes, but despite their importance, little is known on the general structure of infection and resistance between most phages and bacteria. For example, are bacteria–phage communities characterized by complex patterns of overlapping exploitation networks, do they conform to a more ordered general pattern across all communities, or are they idiosyncratic and hard to predict from one ecosystem to the next? To answer these questions, we collect and present a detailed metaanalysis of 38 laboratory-verified studies of host–phage interactions representing almost 12,000 distinct experimental infection assays across a broad spectrum of taxa, habitat, and mode of selection. In so doing, we present evidence that currently available host–phage infection networks are statistically different from random networks and that they possess a characteristic nested structure. This nested structure is typified by the finding that hard to infect bacteria are infected by generalist phages (and not specialist phages) and that easy to infect bacteria are infected by generalist and specialist phages. Moreover, we find that currently available host–phage infection networks do not typically possess a modular structure. We explore possible underlying mechanisms and significance of the observed nested host–phage interaction structure. In addition, given that most of the available host–phage infection networks examined here are composed of taxa separated by short phylogenetic distances, we propose that the lack of modularity is a scale-dependent effect, and then, we describe experimental studies to test whether modular patterns exist at macroevolutionary scales.},

This is usually interpreted in terms of Fisher's fundamental theorem to mean that populations are near evolutionary equilibrium and genetic variance in total fitness is low. We develop the causal relationship between metric traits and life-history traits to show that a life-history trait is expected to have a low heritability whether or not the population is at equilibrium. This is because it is subject to all the environmental variation in the metric traits that affect it plus additional environmental variation. There is no simple prediction regarding levels of additive genetic variance in life-history traits, which may be high at equilibrium. Several other patterns in the inheritance of life-history traits are readily predicted from the causal model. These include the strength of genetic correlations between life-history traits, levels of nonadditive genetic variance, and the inevitability of genotype-environment interaction.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2828804},
	abstract = {Rapid divergence and speciation can occur between populations with or without ecological differences under selection for success in intraspecific social competition-competition in which an individual must win in contests or comparisons with conspecific rivals in order to gain access to some resource, including (under sexual selection) mates. Sexual selection theory is extended to encompass social competition for resources other than mates. Characters used in social competition can undergo particularly rapid and divergent evolution owing to (1) their great importance in determining access to critical resources, (2) the absence of a limit to change (except by selection in other contexts), (3) the generation-to-generation relentlessness of selection on these traits. (4) the potential for mutually accelerating evolution of preference and attractiveness in contests involving "choice," and (5) the very large number of factors that can initiate trends, including mutation and drift leading to use of different physiological or behavioral characteristics as signals, the role of novelty per se in the evolution of combat and display, ecological or habitat differences influencing the form of combat and of signals, and (in species capable of learning) imitation of idiosyncratic characteristics of successful individuals. Many species-specific signals heretofore attributed to selection for species recognition ("isolating mechanisms") are probably instead products of social selection. This may help explain the rarity of reproductive character displacement and other phenomena predicted by the species recognition hypothesis. Examples from a wide variety of organisms illustrate patterns predicted by social selection theory, including (1) exaggeration and rapid divergence of traits (e.g., weapons, pheromones, plumage, flowers, and song) used in social competition, (2) a correlation between type of social system (intensity of social selection) and distinctiveness and exaggeration of social traits, (3) sexually monomorphic extreme development of socially selected traits when both sexes compete socially, (4) occurrence of distinctive signals in allopatric populations lacking sympatric congeners, and (5) more rapid divergence (less phylogenetic conservatism) of socially competitive compared to non-competitive signals. Rapid divergence under social selection may accelerate speciation due to effects on pre-mating interactions, as well as on critical social determinants of survival and reproductive success which would put hybrids at a disadvantage. Maintenance of parapatric boundaries (extensive contact with little or no geographic overlap) between socially selected species may sometimes be due to competitive exclusion in sympatry between populations whose primary divergence has been social rather than ecological. Patterns of variation in socially selected characters demonstrate the wisdom of Darwin's distinction between natural and sexual selection, and the applicability of sexual selection theory to social competition in general.},

Even in the absence of genetic instability, rapid evolution can result from an interaction of natural and sexual selection with random genetic drift along lines of equilibria. The models elucidate genetic mechanisms that can initiate or contribute to rapid speciation by sexual isolation and divergence of secondary sexual characters.},

They offer an opportunity to test generalizations about living systems that may extend beyond the organic life that biologists usually study. Here we have generated two classes of digital organism: simple programs selected solely for rapid replication, and complex programs selected to perform mathematical operations that accelerate replication through a set of defined 'metabolic' rewards. To examine the differences in their genetic architecture, we introduced millions of single and multiple mutations into each organism and measured the effects on the organism's fitness. The complex organisms are more robust than the simple ones with respect to the average effects of single mutations. Interactions among mutations are common and usually yield higher fitness than predicted from the component mutations assuming multiplicative effects; such interactions are especially important in the complex organisms. Frequent interactions among mutations have also been seen in bacteria, fungi and fruitflies. Our findings support the view that interactions are a general feature of genetic systems.},

	abstract = {A biological system is robust to mutations if it continues to function after genetic changes in its parts. Such robustness is pervasive on different levels of biological organization, from macromolecules to genetic networks and whole organisms. I here ask which of two possible causes of such robustness are more important on a genome-wide scale, for systems whose parts are genes, such as metabolic and genetic networks. The first of the two causes is redundancy of a system's parts: A gene may be dispensable if the genome contains redundant, back-up copies of the gene. The second cause, distributed robustness, is more poorly understood. It emerges from the distributed nature of many biological systems, where many (and different) parts contribute to system functions. I will here discuss evidence suggesting that distributed robustness is equally or more important for mutational robustness than gene redundancy. This evidence comes from the functional divergence of redundant genes, as well as from large-scale gene deletion studies. I also ask whether one can quantify the extent to which redundancy or distributed robustness contribute to mutational robustness. BioEssays 27:176–188, 2005. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Any genetic change in this mapping reflects a change in development. Here, we discuss evidence for variation in pleiotropy and propose the selection, pleiotropy and compensation model (SPC) for adaptive evolution. It predicts that adaptive change in one character is associated with deleterious pleiotropy in others and subsequent selection to compensate for these pleiotropic effects. The SPC model provides a unifying perspective for a variety of puzzling phenomena, including developmental systems drift and character homogenization. The model suggests that most adaptive signatures detected in genome scans could be the result of compensatory changes, rather than of progressive character adaptations.},

While such natural transformation systems may provide many of the same benefits that sexual reproduction provides eukaryotes, there are important differences that critically alter the consequences, especially when recombination's main benefit is reducing the mutation load. Here, analytical and numerical methods are used to study the selection of transformation genes in populations undergoing deleterious mutation. Selection for transformability depends on the shape of the fitness function against mutation. If the fitness function is linear, then transformation would be selectively neutral were it not for the possibility that transforming cells may take up DNA that converts them into nontransformable cells. If the selection includes strong positive (synergistic) epistasis, then transformation can be advantageous in spite of this risk. The effect of low quality DNA (from selectively killed cells) on selection is then studied analytically and found to impose an additional cost. The limited data available for real bacterial populations suggest that the conditions necessary for the evolution of transformation are unlikely to be met, and thus that DNA uptake may have some function other than recombination of deleterious mutations.},

Here, we present a comprehensive large scale characterization of modularity across the bacterial tree of life, systematically quantifying the modularity of the metabolic networks of \&gt;300 bacterial species. Three main determinants of metabolic network modularity are identified. First, network size is an important topological determinant of network modularity. Second, several environmental factors influence network modularity, with endosymbionts and mammal-specific pathogens having lower modularity scores than bacterial species that occupy a wider range of niches. Moreover, even among the pathogens, those that alternate between two distinct niches, such as insect and mammal, tend to have relatively high metabolic network modularity. Third, horizontal gene transfer is an important force that contributes significantly to metabolic modularity. We additionally reconstruct the metabolic network of ancestral bacterial species and examine the evolution of modularity across the tree of life. This reveals a trend of modularity decrease from ancestors to descendants that is likely the outcome of niche specialization and the incorporation of peripheral metabolic reactions.},

Our results indicate that, on average, at least 81 ± 15\% of the genes in each genome studied were involved in lateral gene transfer at some point in their history, even though they can be vertically inherited after acquisition, uncovering a substantial cumulative effect of lateral gene transfer on longer evolutionary time scales.},

Theory suggests that modularity promotes evolvability, and that aggravating (synergistic) epistasis among deleterious mutations facilitates the evolution of sex. Here, by contrast, we investigate the evolution of different genetic architectures using digital organisms, which are computer programs that self-replicate, mutate, compete and evolve. Specifically, we investigate how genetic architecture is shaped by reproductive mode. We allowed 200 populations of digital organisms to evolve for over 10 000 generations while reproducing either asexually or sexually. For 10 randomly chosen organisms from each population, we constructed and analysed all possible single mutants as well as one million mutants at each mutational distance from 2 to 10. The genomes of sexual organisms were more modular than asexual ones; sites encoding different functional traits had less overlap and sites encoding a particular trait were more tightly clustered. Net directional epistasis was alleviating (antagonistic) in both groups, although the overall strength of this epistasis was weaker in sexual than in asexual organisms. Our results show that sexual reproduction profoundly influences the evolution of the genetic architecture.},

	abstract = {Evolvability is the ability to respond to a selective challenge. This requires the capacity to produce the right kind of variation for selection to act upon. To understand evolvability we therefore need to understand the variational properties of biological organisms. Modularity is a variational property, which has been linked to evolvability. If different characters are able to vary independently, selection will be able to optimize each character separately without interference. But although modularity seems like a good design principle for an evolvable organism, it does not therefore follow that it is the only design that can achieve evolvability. In this essay I analyze the effects of modularity and, more generally, pleiotropy on evolvability. Although, pleiotropy causes interference between the adaptation of different characters, it also increases the variational potential of those characters. The most evolvable genetic architectures may often be those with an intermediate level of integration among characters, and in particular those where pleiotropic effects are variable and able to compensate for each other’s constraints.},

	abstract = {Since the introduction of antibiotics in the late 1940s there has been an inexorable propagation of antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial pathogens (and their relatives). This survival phenomenon was first characterized as the appearance of point mutations that altered drug targets, but in the mid-1950s transmissible antibiotic resistance genes were reported in Japan. Since this time both resistance strategies have been used, often in concert. For some types of antibiotic, only resistance by mutation has been identified, for others only resistance by plasmid acquisition. There is conflicting evidence with respect to the presence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens in the 'pre-antibiotic' era; however, it is likely that the evolution of antibiotic resistance occurred over short periods. Thus, antibiotic resistance gene must be common in the environment, but their derivation remains to be established conclusively. This paper examines the proposals that antibiotic resistance genes originated in the bacterial population, either as bona fide resistance genes or genes encoding metabolic functions. In addition, the acquisition of heterologous resistance determinants by different genetic elements, their intergeneric exchange mechanisms, and the possible roles of antibiotics in the processes are discussed. Are there prospects for drug intervention that eliminate or retard these natural evolutionary processes?},

Levy 1997 Over the last 50 years, the rapid increase in the use of antibiotics, not only in people, but also in animal husbandry and agriculture, has delivered a selection unprecedented in the history of evolution. Consequently, society is facing one of its gravest public health problems-the emergence of infectious bacteria with resistance to many, and in some cases all, available antibiotics. This book brings together a multidisciplinary group of experts to discuss this problem. It begins by examining the origins of resistance and goes on to look at how the use of antibiotics in human medicine and farming/agriculture has selected for resistant bacteria. Separate chapters describe the evolution of resistance determinants and how these are spread both within and between bacterial species. Finally, the book contains discussions on strategies for countering the threat of antibiotic resistance. A major re-thinking of our approach to the treatment of infectious diseases is proposed-that antibiotic resistance should be seen as a problem created by the disruption of normal microbial ecology. To restore efficacy to earlier antibiotics, and to maintain the success of new antibiotics that are introduced, we need to use these drugs in a way that ensures an ecological balance that favours the predominance of susceptible bacteria.},

Such constraints, typically, can be broken even within the taxa to which they apply, though with varying degrees of difficulty. The origin of constraints is discussed, five distinctive of constraint being explicitly considered. Three means of identifying constraints are set forth, as well as four means of distinguishing developmental from selective constraints. None of the latter (use of a priori adaptive predictions, direct measurement of selection, direct measurement of heritable variation, and use of the comparative method) is foolproof. In the final section, three larger issues regarding the role of developmental constraints in evolution are discussed: the extent to which evolutionary stasis can be explained in developmental terms, the extend to which evolutionary trends and patterns might be a consequence of developmental constraints, and the extent to which various genetic and developmental mechanisms have evolved in virtue of the need of lineages to manifest evolutionary plasticity (or adaptability) if they are to survive. Although no definitive conclusions are reached on these larger issues, we bring recent advances in developmental biology, evolutionary theory, and (to a limited extent) molecular biology to bear on them.},

	abstract = {Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties. Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species.},

	abstract = {Sexual competition is associated closely with parental care because the sex providing less care has a higher potential rate of reproduction, and hence more to gain from competing for multiple mates. Sex differences in choosiness are not easily explained, however. The lower-caring sex (often males) has both higher costs of choice, because it is more difficult to find replacement mates, and higher direct benefits, because the sex providing more care (usually females) is likely to exhibit more variation in the quality of contributions to the young. Because both the costs and direct benefits of mate choice increase with increasing parental care by the opposite sex, general predictions about sex difference in choosiness are difficult. Furthermore, the level of choosiness of one sex will be influenced by the choosiness of the other. Here, we present an ESS model of mutual mate choice, which explicitly incorporates differences between males and females in life history traits that determine the costs and benefits of choice, and we illustrate our results with data from species with contrasting forms of parental care. The model demonstrates that sex differences in costs of choice are likely to have a much stronger effect on choosiness than are differences in quality variation, so that the less competitive sex will commonly be more choosy However, when levels of male and female care are similar, differences in quality variation may lead to higher levels of both choice and competition in the same sex.},

	abstract = {There are two distinct reasons for making comparisons of genetic variation for quantitative characters. The first is to compare evolvabilities, or ability to respond to selection, and the second is to make inferences about the forces that maintain genetic variability. Measures of variation that are standardized by the trait mean, such as the additive genetic coefficient of variation, are appropriate for both purposes. Variation has usually been compared as narrow sense heritabilities, but this is almost always an inappropriate comparative measure of evolvability and variability. Coefficients of variation were calculated from 842 estimates of trait means, variances and heritabilities in the literature. Traits closely related to fitness have higher additive genetic and nongenetic variability by the coefficient of variation criterion than characters under weak selection. This is the reverse of the accepted conclusion based on comparisons of heritability. The low heritability of fitness components is best explained by their high residual variation. The high additive genetic and residual variability of fitness traits might be explained by the great number of genetic and environmental events they are affected by, or by a lack of stabilizing selection to reduce their phenotypic variance. Over one-third of the quantitative genetics papers reviewed did not report trait means or variances. Researchers should always report these statistics, so that measures of variation appropriate to a variety of situations may be calculated.},

Many of the mechanisms that connect signaling proteins into networks are highly modular: The core catalytic activity of a signaling protein is physically and functionally separable from molecular domains or motifs that determine its linkage to both inputs and outputs. This high degree of modularity may make these systems more evolvable—in principle, novel circuits, and therefore highly innovative regulatory behaviors, can arise from relatively simple genetic events such as recombination, deletion, or insertion. In support of this hypothesis, recent studies show that such modular systems can be exploited to engineer nonnatural signaling proteins and pathways with novel behavior.},

We wondered if there are pivotal proteins in these pathways that have been repeatedly responsible for forming new connections through evolution, thus changing the topology of the network; and if so, whether the underlying properties of these proteins could be exploited to re-engineer and rewire these pathways. We addressed these questions in the context of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. MAPK proteins were found to have repeatedly acquired new specificities and interaction partners during evolution, suggesting that these proteins are pivotal in the kinase network. Using the MAPKs Fus3 and Hog1 of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating and hyper-osmolar pathways, respectively, we show that these pivotal proteins can be re-designed to achieve a wide variety of changes in the input-output properties of the MAPK network. Through an analysis of our experimental results and of the sequence and structure of these proteins, we show that rewiring of the network is possible due to the underlying modular design of the MAPKs.

Furthermore, they show reuse of recurring patterns termed network motifs. Little is known about the evolutionary origin of these properties. Current models of biological evolution typically produce networks that are highly nonmodular and lack understandable motifs. Here, we suggest a possible explanation for the origin of modularity and network motifs in biology. We use standard evolutionary algorithms to evolve networks. A key feature in this study is evolution under an environment (evolutionary goal) that changes in a modular fashion. That is, we repeatedly switch between several goals, each made of a different combination of subgoals. We find that such “modularly varying goals” lead to the spontaneous evolution of modular network structure and network motifs. The resulting networks rapidly evolve to satisfy each of the different goals. Such switching between related goals may represent biological evolution in a changing environment that requires different combinations of a set of basic biological functions. The present study may shed light on the evolutionary forces that promote structural simplicity in biological networks and offers ways to improve the evolutionary design of engineered systems.},

These findings have interesting implications on our understanding of how new enzymes evolve. They support the key role of catalytic promiscuity in the natural history of enzymes, and suggest that today's enzymes diverged from ancestral proteins catalyzing a whole range of activities at low levels, to create families and superfamilies of potent and highly specialized enzymes.},

This ability is dependent on the induction of new phenotypic traits by a small number of mutations (plasticity). But mutations often have deleterious effects on functions that are essential for survival. How are these seemingly conflicting demands met at the single-protein level? Results from directed laboratory evolution experiments indicate that the evolution of a new function is driven by mutations that have little effect on the native function but large effects on the promiscuous functions that serve as starting point. Thus, an evolving protein can initially acquire increased fitness for a new function without losing its original function. Gene duplication and the divergence of a completely new protein may then follow.},

	abstract = {Influenza A virus is characterized by a large host range and rapid antigenic drift—features not common to many viruses. To begin to understand the molecular basis behind these features, we performed genome-wide mutagenesis to gauge the relative flexibility of the viral genome. We found that only two small regions in the genome (the hemagglutinin head domain and nonstructural protein 1) were highly tolerant to transposon-based insertional mutation. We believe that this analysis highlights an evolutionary strategy of influenza A virus: maintain highly plastic domains in proteins required for rapid host adaptation. This finding may help explain why influenza viruses possess certain traits not common to all RNA viruses., The molecular basis for the diversity across influenza strains is poorly understood. To gain insight into this question, we mutagenized the viral genome and sequenced recoverable viruses. Only two small regions in the genome were enriched for insertions, the hemagglutinin head and the immune-modulatory nonstructural protein 1. These proteins play a major role in host adaptation, and thus need to be able to evolve rapidly. We propose a model in which certain influenza A virus proteins (or protein domains) exist as highly plastic scaffolds, which will readily accept mutations yet retain their functionality. This model implies that the ability to rapidly acquire mutations is an inherent aspect of influenza HA and nonstructural protein 1 proteins; further, this may explain why rapid antigenic drift and a broad host range is observed with influenza A virus and not with some other RNA viruses.},

I will review results of several in silico evolutionary studies which examine the consequences of evolving the genetic coding, and the ways this information is transformed, while adapting to prevailing environments. Such multilevel evolution leads to long-term information integration. Through genome, network, and dynamical structuring, the occurrence and/or effect of random mutations becomes nonrandom, and facilitates rapid adaptation. This is what does happen in the in silico experiments. Is it also what did happen in biological evolution? I will discuss some data that suggest that it did.

It is therefore of interest to look for generic ways, compatible with natural conditions, in which evolution in simulations can be speeded. Here, we study the impact of temporally varying goals on the speed of evolution, defined as the number of generations needed for an initially random population to achieve a given goal. Using computer simulations, we find that evolution toward goals that change over time can, in certain cases, dramatically speed up evolution compared with evolution toward a fixed goal. The highest speedup is found under modularly varying goals, in which goals change over time such that each new goal shares some of the subproblems with the previous goal. The speedup increases with the complexity of the goal: the harder the problem, the larger the speedup. Modularly varying goals seem to push populations away from local fitness maxima, and guide them toward evolvable and modular solutions. This study suggests that varying environments might significantly contribute to the speed of natural evolution. In addition, it suggests a way to accelerate optimization algorithms and improve evolutionary approaches in engineering.},

Because the average neutrality is independent of evolutionary parameters—such as mutation rate, population size, and selective advantage—one can infer global statistics of neutral network topology by using simple population data available from in vitro or in vivo evolution.

Therefore, widespread variation affecting morphogenic pathways exists in nature, but is usually silent; Hsp90 buffers this variation, allowing it to accumulate under neutral conditions. When Hsp90 buffering is compromised, for example by temperature, cryptic variants are expressed and selection can lead to the continued expression of these traits, even when Hsp90 function is restored. This provides a plausible mechanism for promoting evolutionary change in otherwise entrenched developmental processes.},

	abstract = {We examine a simple form of the evolution of evolvability—the evolution of mutation rates—in a simple model system. The system is composed of many agents moving, reproducing, and dying in a two-dimensional resource-limited world. We first examine various macroscopic quantities (three types of genetic diversity, a measure of population fitness, and a measure of evolutionary activity) as a function of fixed mutation rates. The results suggest that (i) mutation rate is a control parameter that governs a transition between two qualitatively different phases of evolution, an ordered phase characterized by punctuated equilibria of diversity, and a disordered phase of characterized by noisy fluctuations around an equilibrium diversity, and (ii) the ability of evolution to create adaptive structure is maximized when the mutation rate is just below the transition between these two phases of evolution. We hypothesize that this transition occurs when the demands for evolutionary memory and evolutionary novelty are typically balanced. We next allow the mutation rate itself to evolve, and we observe that evolving mutation rates adapt to values at this transition. Furthermore, the mutation rates adapt up (or down) as the evolutionary demands for novelty (or memory) increase, thus supporting the balance hypothesis.},

	abstract = {All living things are remarkably complex, yet their DNA is unstable, undergoing countless random mutations over generations. Despite this instability, most animals do not grow two heads or die, plants continue to thrive, and bacteria continue to divide. Robustness and Evolvability in Living Systems tackles this perplexing paradox. The book explores why genetic changes do not cause organisms to fail catastrophically and how evolution shapes organisms' robustness. Andreas Wagner looks at this problem from the ground up, starting with the alphabet of DNA, the genetic code, RNA, and protein molecules, moving on to genetic networks and embryonic development, and working his way up to whole organisms. He then develops an evolutionary explanation for robustness.  Wagner shows how evolution by natural selection preferentially finds and favors robust solutions to the problems organisms face in surviving and reproducing. Such robustness, he argues, also enhances the potential for future evolutionary innovation. Wagner also argues that robustness has less to do with organisms having plenty of spare parts (the redundancy theory that has been popular) and more to do with the reality that mutations can change organisms in ways that do not substantively affect their fitness.  Unparalleled in its field, this book offers the most detailed analysis available of all facets of robustness within organisms. It will appeal not only to biologists but also to engineers interested in the design of robust systems and to social scientists concerned with robustness in human communities and populations.},

Biological systems are extraordinarily robust to perturbation by mutations, recombination and the environment. It has been proposed that this robustness might make them more evolvable. Robustness to mutation allows genetic variation to accumulate in a cryptic state. Switching mechanisms known as evolutionary capacitors mean that the amount of heritable phenotypic variation available can be correlated to the degree of stress and hence to the novelty of the environment and remaining potential for adaptation. There have been two somewhat separate literatures relating robustness to evolvability. One has focused on molecular phenotypes and new mutations, the other on morphology and cryptic genetic variation. Here, we review both literatures, and show that the true distinction is whether recombination rates are high or low. In both cases, the evidence supports the claim that robustness promotes evolvability.},

I find that cryptic genetic variation can be substantially enriched for potential adaptations under a broad range of realistic parameter values, including those applicable to alternative splices and readthrough products generated by the yeast prion [PSI+]. This enrichment is dramatically stronger when multiple simultaneous changes are required to generate a potentially adaptive phenotype. Cryptic genetic variation is likely to be an effective source of useful adaptations at a time of environmental change, relative to an equivalent source of variation that has not spent time in a hidden state.},

However, as asexual genotypes become common, they may also become disproportionately infected by parasites. The Red Queen hypothesis postulates that high infection rates in the common asexual clones could periodically favor the genetically diverse sexual individuals and promote the short‐term coexistence of sexual and asexual populations. Testing this idea requires comparison of competing sexual and asexual lineages that are attacked by natural parasites. To date no such data have been available. Here, we report on long‐term dynamics and parasite coevolution in a “mixed” (sexual and asexual) population of snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). We found that, within 7–10 years, the most common clones were almost completely replaced by initially rare clones in two different habitats, while sexuals persisted throughout the study period. The common clones, which were initially more resistant to infection, also became more susceptible to infection by sympatric (but not allopatric) parasites over the course of the study. These results are consistent with the Red Queen hypothesis and show that the coevolutionary dynamics predicted by the theory may also favor sexual reproduction in natural populations.},

	abstract = {Abstract: In diploids, sex affects genetic variation through segregation and recombination. Several recent models on the advantage of recombination have focused on the effect of interaction between selection and drift in finite or structured populations; however, these models considered haploid organisms. In this article, I present a three‐locus model of the evolution of recombination in structured diploid populations, including dominance and epistatic effects among alleles. This model shows that dominance generates a selective force against recombination due to the fact that recombination reduces correlations in homozygosity that are generated by population structure. This result is confirmed by multilocus simulations (representing deleterious mutations occurring over a whole genome), showing that when mutations are sufficiently recessive, the population evolves to zero recombination. In the presence of epistasis, the same effect of recombination on correlations in homozygosity generates an advantage for recombination under negative dominance by dominance epistasis ( \$e\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}{\textbackslash},\}\$ ). Additive by additive epistasis ( \$e\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{a\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}mathrm\{a\}{\textbackslash},\}\$ ) favors recombination when it is negative and sufficiently weak, while additive by dominance epistasis has less effect. Some of these effects, however, are reversed when the deleterious mutation rate \$U\$ is sufficiently high: in that case, strongly negative \$e\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{a\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}mathrm\{a\}{\textbackslash},\}\$ can favor recombination, while negative \$e\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}times {\textbackslash}mathrm\{d\}{\textbackslash},\}\$ disfavors it.

	abstract = {Abstract: Recent modeling has shown that condition‐dependent sex can evolve much more readily than sex that occurs at a uniform rate, even in the face of substantial costs of sex. Specifically, evolution favors genes that cause organisms to allocate more resources to sexual reproduction when they are in poor condition and to asexual reproduction—including increased life span—when they are in good condition. This form of fitness‐associated sex (FAS) evolves because modifier genes that promote their own escape from low‐fitness genetic backgrounds and that remain longer in high‐fitness genetic backgrounds rise in frequency alongside the spread of high‐fitness genotypes due to selection. Importantly, FAS does not evolve because it is good for the individual or good for the species but because it is in the selfish interest of modifier genes that promote FAS to move from low‐ to high‐fitness genetic backgrounds. Even though FAS does not evolve for the good of its descendants, we show here that FAS often hastens the rate of adaptation. Ironically, the rate of adaptation is most likely to be accelerated by FAS when sex is costly, because FAS makes it more likely that individuals in poor condition will suffer the costs of sex, improving the efficiency with which less fit alleles are eliminated.},

Segregation breaks down some types of genetic associations that are not affected by recombination and thus influences the evolution of sex in ways that are not apparent from studying the evolution of recombination as a surrogate for sex. Here I examine the evolution of sex in diploids experiencing spatially heterogeneous selection. If divergent selection causes genetic differentiation, then migration can be a powerful force generating genetic associations that may not be favored by selection. An advantage to sex can arise from breaking down these associations. By examining modifiers of both sex and recombination, the model allows for a direct comparison of the forces acting on these related but different processes, illuminating the role of segregation. The model also includes inbreeding, which has been shown to be important for both segregation and recombination.

We use computer simulations of a mathematical model of host‐parasite coevolution to measure those effects under a wide range of parameters. We find that the real driving force underlying the Red Queen hypothesis is neither the immediate, next‐generation, short‐term effect nor the long‐term effect but in fact a delayed short‐term effect.

Recent efforts to find negative epistasis as a source of negative linkage disequilibrium and associated long‐term advantage to sex have yielded little support. Sign epistasis, where the sign of the fitness effects of alleles varies across genetic backgrounds, is responsible for the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, with several unexplored implications for the evolution of sex. Here, we describe fitness landscapes for two sets of strains of the asexual fungus Aspergillus niger involving all combinations of five mutations. We find that ∼30\% of the single‐mutation fitness effects are positive despite their negative effect in the wild‐type strain and that several local fitness maxima and minima are present. We then compare adaptation of sexual and asexual populations on these empirical fitness landscapes by using simulations. The results show a general disadvantage of sex on these rugged landscapes, caused by the breakdown by recombination of genotypes on fitness peaks. Sex facilitates movement to the global peak only for some parameter values on one landscape, indicating its dependence on the landscape’s topography. We discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between our results and the reports of faster adaptation of sexual populations.},

The additive variance is often measured as heritability, the fraction of the total phenotypic variance that is additive. Heritability is thus a common measure of evolutionary potential. An alternative is to measure evolutionary potential as expected proportional change under a unit strength of selection. This yields the mean-scaled additive variance as a measure of evolvability. Houle in Genetics 130:195–204, (1992) showed that these two ways of scaling additive variance are often inconsistent and can lead to different conclusions as to what traits are more evolvable. Here, we explore this relation in more detail through a literature review, and through theoretical arguments. We show that the correlation between heritability and evolvability is essentially zero, and we argue that this is likely due to inherent positive correlations between the additive variance and other components of phenotypic variance. This means that heritabilities are unsuitable as measures of evolutionary potential in natural populations. More generally we argue that scaling always involves non-trivial assumptions, and that a lack of awareness of these assumptions constitutes a systemic error in the field of evolutionary biology.},

	abstract = {The distribution of fitness effects of protein mutations is still unknown. Of particular interest is whether accumulating deleterious mutations interact, and how the resulting epistatic effects shape the protein's fitness landscape. Here we apply a model system in which bacterial fitness correlates with the enzymatic activity of TEM-1 beta-lactamase (antibiotic degradation). Subjecting TEM-1 to random mutational drift and purifying selection (to purge deleterious mutations) produced changes in its fitness landscape indicative of negative epistasis; that is, the combined deleterious effects of mutations were, on average, larger than expected from the multiplication of their individual effects. As observed in computational systems, negative epistasis was tightly associated with higher tolerance to mutations (robustness). Thus, under a low selection pressure, a large fraction of mutations was initially tolerated (high robustness), but as mutations accumulated, their fitness toll increased, resulting in the observed negative epistasis. These findings, supported by FoldX stability computations of the mutational effects, prompt a new model in which the mutational robustness (or neutrality) observed in proteins, and other biological systems, is due primarily to a stability margin, or threshold, that buffers the deleterious physico-chemical effects of mutations on fitness. Threshold robustness is inherently epistatic-once the stability threshold is exhausted, the deleterious effects of mutations become fully pronounced, thereby making proteins far less robust than generally assumed.},

The accepted paradigm that proteins can tolerate nearly any amino acid substitution has been replaced by the view that the deleterious effects of mutations, and especially their tendency to undermine the thermodynamic and kinetic stability of protein, is a major constraint on protein evolvability—the ability of proteins to acquire changes in sequence and function. We summarize recent findings regarding how mutations affect protein stability, and how stability affects protein evolution. We describe ways of predicting and analyzing stability effects of mutations, and mechanisms that buffer or compensate for these destabilizing effects and thereby promote protein evolvabilty, in nature and in the laboratory.},

We consider an alternative, “avant-garde view” in which proteins are conformationally dynamic and exhibit functional promiscuity. We surmise that these properties are the foundation stones of protein evolvability; they facilitate the divergence of new functions within existing folds and the evolution of entirely new folds. Packing modes of proteins also affect their evolvability, and poorly packed, disordered, and conformationally diverse proteins may exhibit high evolvability. This dynamic view of protein structure, function, and evolvability is extrapolated to describe hypothetical scenarios for the evolution of the early proteins and future research directions in the area of protein dynamism and evolution.},

These estimates show that pleiotropy is highly restricted and are more in line with the notion of variational modularity than with universal pleiotropy.

I focus here on biological systems that are robust to mutations and ask whether such systems are more or less evolvable, in the sense that they can acquire novel properties. The more robust a system is, the more mutations in it are neutral, that is, without phenotypic effect. I argue here that such neutral change – and thus robustness – can be a key to future evolutionary innovation, if one accepts that neutrality is not an essential feature of a mutation. That is, a once neutral mutation may cause phenotypic effects in a changed environment or genetic background. I argue that most, if not all, neutral mutations are of this sort, and that the essentialist notion of neutrality should be abandoned. This perspective reconciles two opposing views on the forces dominating organismal evolution, natural selection and random drift: neutral mutations occur and are especially abundant in robust systems, but they do not remain neutral indefinitely, and eventually become visible to natural selection, where some of them lead to evolutionary innovations.},

The conditions for crystallization of orderly behavior in such networks are specified. Most critical is the emergence of a “frozen component” of the binary variables, in which some variables are frozen in the active or inactive state. Such frozen components across a Boolean network leave behind functionally isolated islands which are not frozen.

Adaptive evolution or learning in such networks via near mutant variants depends upon the structure of the corresponding “fitness landscape”. Such landscapes may be smooth and single peaked, or highly rugged. Networks with frozen components tend to adapt on smoother landscapes than those with no frozen component. In coevolving systems, fitness landscapes themselves deform due to coupling between coevolving partners. Conditions for optimal coevolution may include tuning of landscape structure for the emergence of frozen components among the coadapting entities in the system.},

By replaying evolution many times from these clones, we showed that the eventual winners likely prevailed because they had greater potential for further adaptation.

 conditions of use of the conserved core processes. These regulatory
 processes, and certain of the core processes, have special properties
 relevant to evolutionary change. The properties of versatile protein
 elements, weak linkage, compartmentation, redundancy, and exploratory
 behavior reduce the interdependence of components and confer robustness
 and flexibility on processes during embryonic development and in adult
 physiology. They also confer evolvability on the organism by reducing
 constraints on change and allowing the accumulation of nonlethal
 variation. Evolvability may have been generally selected in the course
 of selection for robust, flexible processes suitable for complex
 development and physiology and specifically selected in lineages
 undergoing repeated radiations.},

	abstract = {Many theories have been proposed to explain the evolution of sex, but the question remains unsettled owing to a paucity of compelling empirical tests. The crux of the problem is to understand the prevalence of sexual reproduction in the natural world, despite obvious costs relative to asexual reproduction. Here we perform experiments with digital organisms (evolving computer programs) to test the hypothesis that sexual reproduction is advantageous in changing environments. We varied the frequency and magnitude of environmental change, while the digital organisms could evolve their mode of reproduction as well as the traits affecting their fitness (reproductive rate) under the various conditions. Sex became the dominant mode of reproduction only when the environment changed rapidly and substantially (with particular functions changing from maladaptive to adaptive and vice versa). Even under these conditions, it was easier to maintain sexual reproduction than for sex to invade a formerly asexual population, although sometimes sex did invade and spread despite the obstacles to becoming established. Several diverse properties of the ancestral genomes, including epistasis and modularity, had no effect on the subsequent evolution of reproductive mode. Our study provides some limited support for the importance of changing environments to the evolution of sex, while also reinforcing the difficulty of evolving and maintaining sexual reproduction.},

	abstract = {Natural selection is shortsighted and therefore does not necessarily drive populations toward improved long-term performance. Some traits may evolve because they provide immediate gains, even though they are less successful in the long run than some alternatives. Here, we use digital organisms to analyze the ability of evolving populations to optimize their mutation rate, a fundamental evolutionary parameter. We show that when the mutation rate is constrained to be high, populations adapt considerably faster over the long term than when the mutation rate is allowed to evolve. By varying the fitness landscape, we show that natural selection tends to reduce the mutation rate on rugged landscapes (but not on smooth ones) so as to avoid the production of harmful mutations, even though this short-term benefit limits adaptation over the long term.},
